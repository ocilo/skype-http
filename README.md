Unofficial Skype API for Node.js via HTTP.
This relies on the Skype Web Application and requires the credentials of the account you want to use: use it with care.

## Installation

````shell
npm install --save skype-http

````

Import for Typescript or Javascript ES6:
````ts
import * as skypeHttp from "skype-http";
````

Import for Javascript ES5:
````js
var skypeHttp = require("skype-http");
````

## Running example

The demo will prompt you your username and password: you should use your Skype account (there is no support for
Microsoft accounts for now).

````shell
git clone https://github.com/demurgos/skype-http
cd skype-http
# Ensure that you have the latest versions of the global dependencies
sudo npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install
npm start
````

This will perform a verbose connection (it should log the acquisition of various tokens), display the list of contacts,
set the status to `"Online"` and start to respond to messages.

## Usage

[See the documentation](./doc/api/package.md)

## Contributing

Here are the main commands available for the project.
The project requires `gulp-cli` and `npm` 4.
The project has three targets:
- `lib`: Build the core library. This is what is published to npm.
  - Sources: `src/lib`
- `test`: Build the library with the _mocha_ unit-tests.
  - Sources: `src/lib` and `src/test`
- `example`: Build the example command-line application.
  - Sources: `src/lib` and `src/example`

### `npm prepare`

Generate the configuration files (`tslint.json`, `tsconfig.json`) and build all
the targets.
These files are not used by the build process (they are read-only) but allow
to use the `tsc` and `tslint` command line programs and help the editors detect
the configuration.

**Note**: This command is executed automatically as part of `npm install`.

### `gulp lib:build`

Build the library.

### `gulp lib:watch`

Watch the sources and rebuild on change.

**Note**: You may have to restart it if you create _new_ files.

### `npm start`

Build `example` and run it.

### `gulp :lint`

Static analysis with `tslint`.

### `gulp test`

Build the `test` target and run the unit tests. Prints the report to
the terminal.

### `npm test`

Run both `gulp :lint` and `gulp lib-test`.
This is executed on each commit and during Travis CI builds.

## Resources

If you just want to create a bot, take a look at <https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder> first.

You can find the decompiled source code of the Skype Web Application on [the `skype-web-reversed` repository](https://github.com/demurgos/skype-web-reversed).

## What's not working and probably never will.

* [Old P2P group chats](https://github.com/ShyykoSerhiy/skyweb/issues/6). According to  [Skype community site ](http://community.skype.com/t5/Skype-for-Web-Beta/Group-chats-missing-on-skype-web/td-p/3884218) only new, Cloud based group chats are shown in SkypeWeb Beta(therefore works in this API). The old P2P group chats are not.  

## Project Background

This project started as a fork of the https://github.com/ShyykoSerhiy/skyweb after slow progress from 3rd party patches. The goal is to provide stronger guarantees about the objects returned by the API (through checks and normalization) and better error management, because scrapping/unofficial API calls are unreliable so the library should be resilient.

## Disclaimer 
This project relies on SkypeWeb Skype implementation. If Microsoft Corporation decides to remove Skype
implementation (or change it in any) skype-http might not be in working state. Therefore it's not recommended to use it 
in any critical part of production code. In fact it's not recommended to use it in production at all.
